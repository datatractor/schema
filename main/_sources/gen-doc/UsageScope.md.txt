```yaml
name: UsageScope
from_schema: https://www.marda-alliance.org/extractors/extractor
rank: 1000
permissible_values:
  meta-only:
    text: meta-only
    description: This usage scope only returns metadata associated with the file,
      according to the extractor's own interpretation of metadata. This may include,
      but is not limited to, timestamps, column headings, data types and data shapes.
      The size of data returned in this mode should be limited and will typically
      be much smaller than the file size. This metadata SHOULD be expressed as a JSON-serializable
      document that can, for example, be loaded into Python with only standard library
      imports.
  meta+data:
    text: meta+data
    description: This usage scope refers to a "full" extraction of the file, whereby
      the extractor tries to faithfully interpret and return all supported information
      contained within the file, including binary data, large multi-dimensional arrays,
      plus all of the associated metadata from a `meta-only` extraction. The size
      of the data returned in this mode is not limited and could be significantly
      larger than the input file size (in the case of binary data, or additional analysis
      being performed upon extraction).
